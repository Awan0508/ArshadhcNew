    problem: 'Anal Fistula',
    quote: 'I reached out to Dr. Asad after visiting his website, having suffered from an anal fistula for the past 10‚Äì12 years. I had previously tried homeopathy several times without success and was seriously considering surgery. However, I decided to give homeopathy one last try and contacted Dr. Asad. After just one month of his treatment, the discharge and pus had reduced by almost 60%. By the second month, it had completely stopped. With his suggested diet changes and medication, I believe I am now on the road to recovery. I\'m sincerely grateful to Dr. Asad‚Äîmay God bless him.',

    quote: 'I was having nasty stomach pains for months and I tried every single doc in my city Peshawar but none helped to relieve my pain. One of my friend told me to try this homeopathic clinic in rwp.I checked out their website and gave them a call. The doc took the time to understand my symptoms even though it was just over the phone and figure out exactly what was going on. Didn\'t rush me at all like other docs.Doc prescribed some homeo medicines for me and had them delivered right to my door. They were super easy to take. The medicine tbey gave me was so gentle. I was worried it wouldn\'t work but sure enough, within a couple weeks the pain was way better. A few more weeks and it was completely gone! I\'m totally healed up now thanks to this doc. I\'d highly recommend consulting with them virtually if you\'re looking for natural healing. Five stars for saving me from this stomach issue!',

After taking treatment from this clinic, Alhamdulillah we saw significant improvement in his ability to socialize. Musa started interacting with kids around him, which was previously challenging for him. We are pleased with the results and think the clinic\'s approach towards treatment is excellent. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they take a holistic approach to the treatment, which includes natural remedies. We trust this clinic, and we would highly recommend it to others who are seeking a non-invasive treatment option for autism.',
